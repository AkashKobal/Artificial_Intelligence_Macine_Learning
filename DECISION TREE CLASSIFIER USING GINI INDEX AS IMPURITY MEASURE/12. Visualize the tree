# In this code, you perform the following steps:

# Import the necessary modules and functions: export_graphviz from sklearn.tree, pydotplus as pdot, and Image from IPython.display.
# Call export_graphviz to export the decision tree model (clf) to the GraphViz format.
#  The out_file parameter specifies the output file name ("tree.odt" in this case), and 
#  the feature_names parameter provides the names of the features in your dataset.
# Use graphviz.graph_from_dot_file from pydotplus to create a graph from the exported GraphViz file ("tree.odt").
# Write the graph to a JPG image file ("tree.png") using write_jpg method of the graph object.
# Display the image using IPython.display.Image by providing the filename of the image ("tree.png").
