# 5. Few of the columns are categorical and are infered as objects. Ex: checkin_acc. Print all unique values of this column
df["checkin_acc"].unique()
# The output of the code "df["checkin_acc"].unique()" will depend on the structure and content of the pandas dataframe named "df". Assuming that there is a column named "checkin_acc" 
#in the dataframe, this code will return an array of unique values that are present in that column. 

# For example, if the "checkin_acc" column contains categorical data related to bank accounts, 
#such as "no account", "low balance", "medium balance", and "high balance", then the output of this code will be an array containing these unique values.

# This code is useful for exploring the unique values in a column of a dataframe, which can help 
#in identifying any data quality issues or patterns in the data. It can also be used for data preprocessing tasks such as encoding categorical variables for machine learning models.
